        <li>Configure fuel cell tank height parameters</li>

        autonomous operation of the fuel cell.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. License Grant</h2>
      <p>Subject to your compliance with these Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable

        <li>You are solely responsible for verifying all configuration settings before operation</li>
